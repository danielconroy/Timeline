Dr. VanDrunen,

I will be emailing you and Daniel a .jar file of our program just in case you cannot compile it normally since we both were using NetBeans and are not sure whether it will compile normally.

We are also writing JUnit tests at the end. However, we researched how to write JUnit tests and will be using them to confirm that we have written the program properly.

Through this experience, we have explored to a greater degree how swing and graphics components work together to create a wonderful user experience. In addition, we learned how to use git and gitHub, such that now we can both use it consistently and without problems. We further had it reinforced to us the importance of thorough testing of code and input filtering and sanitation.

We greatly enjoyed making the aesthetic nature of the project work together cohesively, such as including category colors and displaying those colors dynamically. We originally had trouble with displaying descriptions which we wished to include, but decided on a "static" field in our display which we update through a MouseListener, another useful experience.

Finally, we gained an immense sense of thankfulness for the many guis and displays that we use on a day to day basis. Hurrah for programmers!
